ABOUT
HELLO, I'M PRATHAM - A WEB DEVELOPER AND STUDENT.

Ever since my parents gifted me a laptop, I've been passionate about programming. The endless possibilities of online designs, web apps, and graphics have always fascinated me and motivated me towards web development. I enjoy working with computers, the internet, programs, and the intricate technology that surrounds them. I believe that trying new things and taking risks is essential for personal and professional growth.

Currently, I am pursuing my studies at LJIET in the ICT branch. Despite my academic commitments, I devote a significant amount of time to building my skills. Every day, I learn something new that contributes to my growth as a developer.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities with startups or companies where I can contribute my skills and gain valuable experience. I am excited to work with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful projects that impact people's lives positively.

One of my favorite quotes by Steve Jobs is:

“THE ONLY WAY TO DO GREAT WORK IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO”

These words inspire me to do my best work with passion, dedication, and determination. I believe that hard work and a love for what you do are the keys to success.
